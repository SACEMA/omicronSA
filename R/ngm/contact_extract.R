90 young, 10 old

50 total contacts (1 per person per day)

1 person generates 0.5 contact per day

describing effective contacts, say:
1 young person generates 0.03 contacts with old person
1 old person generates 0.3 contacts with young person

check:
100 young people = 3 contacts with old
10 old = 3 contacts with young

if 33 infectious young people = ~1 infectious exposure to old person per time

I2dot = ... + 0.03 * 33 * 10/10 = ~1 per time

then if old people are 1/2 previously exposed (S_old/N_old = .5), then 50% chance that infectious exposure works

I2dot = ... + 0.03 * 33 * 5/10 = ~0.5 per time

if there are 3 infectious old people, then

I1dot = ... + 0.3 * 3 * 67/100 = 2/3
